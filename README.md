# Fuzzy-C-means-Clustering
A computational intelligence project using fuzzy logic. <br>
# A fuzzy version of clustering algorithm "K-Means"
In this project based on the number of clusters given (C), we divide dots into clusters and the centroids are also shown with black bold dots.
### Plots

By using the elbow method and analyzing the Cost per Cluster plot we can conclude that the optimal C value would be 3.
